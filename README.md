### Limitations
-   Cutscenes are not supported and never will be, as extending them beyond 16:9 would reveal [characters that should not be visible](https://weesp.in/i/86485cec7ec231cb.png).
-   Minigames are also not supported and won't be, since [assets like backgrounds are designed for a 16:9 aspect ratio](https://weesp.in/i/6c04417e053e70c9.png) and would appear distorted if stretched to wider ratios.
